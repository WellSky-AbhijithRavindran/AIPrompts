Development Prompt: Add Group Header Type to Service Verification
Program: #file:hahivsgr.sqlrpgle
Language: SQLRPGLE
Purpose: Enhance the service verification group header functionality by introducing a new field to store Group Header Type (BGRGTP).

File & Structure Updates
- Target File: #file:hapivsgr.pf
- Add a new field: groupHdrTyp (camelCase format) to store the Group Header Type.
- Data Structure Update:
- Modify the grpGrd data structure to include the new subfield groupHdrTyp.
- Ensure the implementation mirrors the structure and handling of the existing authNumber field.

Validation Logic
- Cross-Reference Validation:
- Use XFXTABL functionality to validate groupHdrTyp against table code 'IVTP'.
- If invalid, set error code '00003962'.
- Existence Check via Embedded SQL:
- If groupHdrTyp is valid, perform an embedded SQL query to check for existing records in HAPIVSVC.
- Match on level6, account, and groupNumber.
- If a record exists, trigger appropriate error handling.

Field Naming Convention
- All new fields must follow camelCase naming.
- Example: groupHdrTyp instead of GROUPHDRTYP.

Implementation Notes
- Ensure new logic is modular and follows existing coding standards.
- Place validation and SQL logic in the appropriate section of the program, maintaining readability and maintainability.
- Comment clearly to indicate new additions and their purpose.
